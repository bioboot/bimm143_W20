## 2:  Sequence alignment fundamentals, algorithms and applications

**Topics**:  
Further coverage of *major NCBI & EBI resources* for the molecular domain of bioinformatics with a focus on GenBank, UniProt, Entrez and Gene Ontology. There are many bioinformatics databases (see [handout]({{ site.baseurl }}/class-material/Major_Databases_BIMM143.pdf){:.no-push-state}) and being able to judge their utility and quality is important. *Sequence Alignment and Database Searching*:
Homology, Sequence similarity, Local and global alignment, Heuristic approaches, Database searching with BLAST, E-values and evaluating alignment scores and statistics.
 

**Goals**:  
- Be able to query, search, compare and contrast the data contained in major bioinformatics databases (GenBank, GENE, UniProt, PFAM, OMIM, PDB) and describe how these databases intersect.  
- Be able to describe how nucleotide and protein sequence and structure data are represented (FASTA, FASTQ, GenBank, UniProt, PDB).
- Be able to describe how dynamic programming works for pairwise sequence alignment 
- Appreciate the differences between global and local alignment along with their major application areas.
- Understand how aligning novel sequences with previously characterized genes or proteins provides important insights into their common attributes and evolutionary origins. 
- The goals of the hands-on session are to explore the principles underlying the computational tools that can be used to compute and evaluate sequence alignments.

## 17: Biological network analysis 
**Topics**: Network graph approaches for integrating and interpreting large heterogeneous high throughput data sets; Discovering relationships in 'omics' data; Network construction, manipulation, visualization and analysis; Graph theory; Major network topology measures and concepts (Degree, Communities, Shortest Paths, Centralities, Betweenness, Random graphs vs scale free); De novo sub-network construction and clustering. Hands-on with Cytoscape and R packages for network visualization and analysis.

**Goals**:
- Be able to describe the major goals of biological network analysis and the concepts underlying network visualization and analysis.   
- Be able to use Cytoscape for network visualization and manipulation.
- Be able to find and instal Cytoscape Apps to extend network analysis functionality.  
- Appreciate that the igraph R package has extensive network analysis functionality beyond that in Cytoscape and that the R bioconductor package RCy3 package allows us to bring networks and associated data from R to Cytoscape so we can have the best of both worlds.
